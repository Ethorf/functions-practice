function chooseBestSum(maxDistance, towns, townsList) {}

//t = the maximum sum of towns
// k = the maximum number of towns to visit
//ls = an array of distances between towns
// this will return the sum of towns closest to the desired distance without going over it, and without exceeding the number of towns

//this fucking question is insanely badly worded
// so we'll need to take in an array and sum all of the elements together in different combinations
// I'm really not sure how to go about adding all these values together, this one may be fucking me right up

//Youd basically need to be checking all groupings of the maximum number of towns together. Gonna have to sit on this one for a bit I think

//1. Maybe the first question would be how many combinations
